# Smartphones vs tablets

Smartphones and tablets can equally be used for Mobile Data Collection (MDC) depending on contexts and survey specificities.

The below table may help to choose between smartphones and tablets:

| **Advantages of smartphones** |	**Advantages of tablets** |
|-----|-----|
| Usually less expensive (better features/price ratio) | Larger screen size good for complex surveys (easier reading and data entry) or a survey carried out indoors |
| Lighter to move (e.g. with neck strap) and to carry (less bulky), particularly for surveys where enumerators spend most of their time standing up | Less likely to be considered as a GPS in the contexts where having GPS is a problem |
| More discreet (easier to conceal when walking about) | In some contexts, less easy to re-sell and therefore less risky of being stolen |
| Better battery life | |
| Better camera | |
| Suitable screen size for most of the surveys | |
| Better connectivity and geo-location (GPS, GSM, 3G, 4G etc.) at equivalent prices| |

If you chose a tablet make sure to check if:

- It can record GPS locations (if required)
- It has a SD card slot (if required)


**Note:** Whatever the type of device is chosen, it is always highly recommended to test it on the field during a couple of days before purchasing a large amount of devices.
